# hello-world
Hello, and thanks for stopping by! I'm passionate about statistics and hope to use this site as a platform to demonstrate and expand my skillset in R and Python. 

As of May 2017 I am just beginning to make contributions to my page. Expect several updates later this month!

Please don't hesitate to reach out with comments or say hi - I'm open to any comments or questions you may have!
